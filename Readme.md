## Financing Education 

## Background

Many of us consider enducation as an important investment for our future well being and particularly an integral part of what government spends for thier citizens to realizing the vision of the coiuntry where all people have a chance to make the most of thier talents. 

But how important is education compared to the other social services that our government provides? 
Are government effictive in providing equal opportunity for all citizens to get educated?

With the ammount of money our government spend, are citizens receiving the level of quality services?
As a result of the education, are we able to achieve the level of income to sustain our living?

In order to answer to those high level questions, we grouped our data analysis into below 3 categories: 

1) Education spending trend  
Key questions:
 
   - How important is the education in relations to public policy?
   - What is the source of education funding?
 
 2) Education equality and effectiveness  
 Key questions:
  		  
   - Are all US citizens receiving education equally?
   - What type of education are they receiving? Teacher effectiveness?
 		  
 3) Education funding effectiveness  
 Key questions:
  		  
   - How much student loans are students taking out?
   - What percentage of household income is spent on education?
   - What is the outcome of education? How much does education impact the future income?
  		  
  		  
  Here are the high level steps we took to analyze the data:

In order to understand how education is financed, and what type of impact it has to the targeted demographics, we broke our analysis down into three category of areas to answer the above questions.




Here are the high level steps we took to analyze the data: 

1) Data gathering

We gathered data from various data sources online and put a reference below in the data source section. Please refer to the data source we used in our data analysis performed. 

2) Data formatting

Many data source had its own data formatting, with specific columne naming standard, and the data type we used. In order to perform our analysis, we used primary keys such as date / year, country, state name to merge our data to do corrolation analysis, and to understand and derive meaningful observation of the data. 

3) Visualization and consolidation 

Each contributor had different technologies they used to visualize the data gathered. Please refer to html page for final visualizaiton and consolidation of the data analytics performed.
