## Financing Education 

## Background

Many of us consider enducation as an important investment for our future well being and particularly an integral part of what government spends for thier citizens to realizing the vision of the coiuntry where all people have a chance to make the most of thier talents. 

But how important is education compared to the other social services that our government provides? 
Are government effictive in providing equal opportunity for all citizens to get educated?

With the ammount of money our government spend, are citizens receiving the level of quality services?
As a result of the education, are we able to achieve the level of income to sustain our living?

In order to answer to those high level questions, we grouped our data analysis into below 3 categories: 

1) Education spending trend  
Key questions:
 
   - How important is the education in relations to public policy?
   - What is the source of education funding?
 
 2) Education equality and effectiveness  
 Key questions:
  		  
   - Are all US citizens receiving education equally?
   - What type of education are they receiving? Teacher effectiveness?
 		  
 3) Education funding effectiveness  
 Key questions:
  		  
   - How much student loans are students taking out?
   - What percentage of household income is spent on education?
   - What is the outcome of education? How much does education impact the future income?
  		  
  		  
  Here are the high level steps we took to analyze the data:

In order to understand how education is financed, and what type of impact it has to the targeted demographics, we broke our analysis down into three category of areas to answer the above questions.




Here are the high level steps we took to analyze the data: 

1) Data gathering

Look for demographic information using the 2014 one-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. You can specify your information using the American FactFinder tool. When searching through the data, be sure to select these options in the left sidebar(http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml):
Topics -> Dataset -> 2014 ACS 1-year estimates
Geographies -> Select a geographic type -> State - 040 -> All States within United States and Puerto Rico

Next, you'll search for data on health risks using 2014 survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 
(https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq)

2) Data formatting

For the two data types chosen, grab the value columns from each and paste them into a new Excel document. Create header names that you can easily call with JavaScript (concise, lowercased, camelCased). Make sure that your rows and columns line upâ€”You may need to delete Guam from your datasheet so that your Census and BRFSS data matches.

3) Visualization

Create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
Scatter plot has:
  The x-values of the circles should match the demographic census data, while the y-values should represent the risk data.
  Include state abbreviations in the circles.

4) iframe-html

Embed it in index.html with an iframe to plot your d3 scatter plot. 

In order to execute the html, run the server localy by using the following command in your terminal
-m http.server <local host address>
